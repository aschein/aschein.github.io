I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu) at Columbia working with [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and [Donald Green](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green) to study voter turnout in US elections. I generally do research on Bayesian statistical models for networks, time series, and text data that arise from complex social processes. Much of my work focuses on methods for decomposing high-dimensional count tensors.

I received my PhD from the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at UMass Amherst under the guidance of [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/) in the Computational Social Science group in the [Machine Learning for Data Science](http://openscholar.cs.umass.edu/mlds/) lab. 
    
Prior to that, I received an MA in Linguistics from UMass Amherst and a dual BA in Linguistics and Political Science also from UMass.
