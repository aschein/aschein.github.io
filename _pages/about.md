I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu) at Columbia working with [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and [Donald Green](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green) to study voter turnout in US elections. I generally do research on Bayesian statistical models for networks, time series, and text data that arise from complex social processes. Much of my work focuses on methods for decomposing high-dimensional count tensors.

I received my PhD from the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at UMass Amherst under the guidance of [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/) in the Computational Social Science group in the [Machine Learning for Data Science](http://openscholar.cs.umass.edu/mlds/) lab. 
    
Prior to that, I received an MA in Linguistics from UMass Amherst and a dual BA in Linguistics and Political Science also from UMass.

## Recent news  
* My [op-ed](https://www.ft.com/content/7e3a6852-464b-4163-8a90-90de7038740e) on the success of Biden's "virtual ground game" was published in the Financial Times. 
* I discussed the election with Professors Gregory Wawro and Robert Shapiro on a panel hosted by the Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal. A recording of our conversation is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqGaklXWNA&ab_channel=ColumbiaUndergraduateScienceJournal).
* Our research was featured in a [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-vote-tripling-project-is-betting-that-non-voters-will-vote-if-a-friend-asks-them-to) on "vote tripling".

* I was featured in an [NBC News article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/coronavirus-ground-game-gamble-hits-home-stretch-n1242803) about Biden's ground game.
* I am organizing a NeurIPS 2020 workshop called "I Can't Believe It's Not Better!" that aims to highlight common failure modes in probabilistic machine learning research. See our [call for papers](https://i-cant-believe-its-not-better.github.io/cfp/) (submission due Oct 14).
* My talk on the causal effect of friend-to-friend texting on voter turnout was awarded **Best Oral Presentation** at IC2S2 2020. Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjD9CKLnTzA&t).
